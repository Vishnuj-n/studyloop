# AI Tutor Architecture

## 1. Architecture Goals: Persistent Queue Model

### What

**Persistent Guided Study Queue** — NOT autonomous AI tutor, hidden orchestration engine, or proactive scheduling system. Queue is recommended guided progression path, but manual/exploratory entry points supported when reusing same canonical bootstrap + topic ownership semantics.

Advanced learning systems = **"Data, not Engines."** Create queue tasks but no orchestration control.

- **Reading Layer**: Validates immediate comprehension + progression readiness (Reading → Quiz → pass/fail → reread or progress).
- **Retention Layer**: Long-term retention via spaced retrieval (Flashcards / Examiner → FSRS update → adaptive review scheduling).
- **Rescue Layer**: 2-strike Socratic rescue for repeated quiz failures (Quiz fail #1 → REREAD → Quiz fail #2 → SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL → re-quiz → mastery or external help).

Canonical checkpoint flow:
Dashboard -> Reader -> Quiz -> Dashboard

Reader completes reading task only. Backend generates + activates QUIZ follow-up task. Dashboard regains ownership after quiz submission + evaluation. Reader → Quiz transition allowed only for generated follow-up quiz tasks and only through queue loop.

**SQLite = source of truth.**

### Why

- **Deterministic**: Predictable, inspectable flow
- **Debuggable**: Queue state = queryable SQL
- **Resumable**: No runtime-only state vanishes on restart
- **Simple**: Solo dev requires low-complexity architecture

### How

- Go + Wails host core services + desktop runtime
- Vue multi-page UI invokes typed backend commands
- **SQLite `study_queue` table drives all user flows**
- SQLite + sqlite-vec store topic-scoped embeddings locally
- ONNX Runtime for local embedding inference via `yalue/onnxruntime_go`
- OpenAI-compatible API for reasoning tasks only

---

## 1.1 The Queue Loop (Core Pattern)

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Dashboard  │────▶│  Fetch Next  │────▶│  Mount      │
│             │     │  PENDING Task│     │  Module     │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                                                 │
                    ┌──────────────┐            ▼
                    │  Insert      │◄────┌─────────────┐
                    │  Follow-up   │     │  Complete   │
                    │  Tasks       │     │  Task       │
                    └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

Queue router ONLY, for queue-driven progression:
- Fetches next pending task from `study_queue` (deterministic ordering)
- Mounts correct module/view based on `task_type`
- Marks tasks complete
- Inserts follow-up queue tasks (explicit rules only)

Reading task producing quiz checkpoint → generated QUIZ task may activate immediately as next queue item. Queue transition, not direct module-to-module orchestration.

Manual study entry points may invoke same module bootstrap + retrieval helpers directly. Must not introduce separate lifecycle implementations.

Router does NOT:
- Manage hidden state machines
- Proactively schedule flows
- Own remediation logic
- Run autonomous pipelines
- Mutate queue in background without trigger

## 2. High-Level Component Design

### What

Core components:
- Desktop shell + backend services
- Frontend pages + sidebar navigation
- Local data layer (SQLite + embedding index)
- LLM provider adapter
- Scheduler services (Reading follow-up + Retention/FSRS)

### Why

Separates concerns while keeping boundaries simple.

### How

- UI sends command-style requests to backend
- Backend executes retrieval, scheduling, + persistence
- AI requests stateless, scoped to current topic only

## 3. Frontend Structure (Vue Multi-Page)

### What

Sidebar sections:

1. Dashboard
2. Reader
3. Notebooks
4. Quiz
5. Flashcards
6. Examiner (WrittenAssessment)
7. Tutor (Socratic)
8. Settings (bottom)
9. Sync (bottom)

Pages open from queue task or manual exploratory action; both converge on same initialization pipeline.

Reader followed immediately by Quiz when backend generates follow-up quiz task. Only Reader → Quiz path allowed.

### Why

Enforces guided flow, keeps AI contextual rather than conversational.

### How

- Dashboard reads daily task queue from scheduler service
- Reader renders parsed sections + Ask AI panel
- Quiz loads topic quiz sets + shows generation status
- Flashcards run FSRS reviews + optional Explain
- Settings stores provider config securely in local app config
- Notebooks manage uploaded PDFs + processing status
- Examiner provides written assessments for long-term retention
- Socratic Tutor enables conversational learning mode

## 4. Data Model

### What

Relational structure with JSON extensions, centered on **persistent queue**.

### Why

- SQL tables → strong queryability for scheduling + progress
- JSON → flexible quiz + card payloads
- **Queue persistence** → resumable, debuggable flows

### Core Tables

**Legacy term note:** Older docs used `blocks` / `block_vectors`. Live schema uses `chunks` + embedding store; see `doc/SCHEMA.md` for exact mappings.

**study_queue (NEW - The Central Queue)**
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | TEXT PK | Unique task identifier |
| `task_type` | TEXT | `READING`, `QUIZ`, `REREAD`, `FLASHCARD_REVIEW`, `MILESTONE_EXAM`, `EXAMINER`, `SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL`, `FLASHCARD_GENERATE` |
| `block_id` | TEXT | Reference to content block (chunk, quiz_set, etc.) |
| `related_id` | TEXT | Optional related topic identifier |
| `status` | TEXT | `PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED` |
| `priority` | INTEGER | Task priority: lower = higher priority (ASC). Note: notebook priority uses opposite convention (higher = more frequent, DESC). |
| `created_at` | INTEGER | Unix timestamp |
| `completed_at` | INTEGER | Unix timestamp (NULL if pending) |

**Supporting Tables**

- `topics` - id, title, status, start_page, end_page, current_page_cursor, created_at, updated_at
- `chunks` - id, topic_id, chunk_text, page_num, token_count, importance_score, weakness_score, embedding_ref, created_at
- `written_questions` - id, topic_id, prompt, source_chunk_id, source_heading, source_page_start, source_page_end
- `written_user_answers` - id, written_question_id, user_answer, score, feedback
- `fsrs_cards` - id, topic_id, source_chunk_id, prompt, answer, state_json, due_at, suspended
- `manual_flashcards` - id, notebook_id, prompt, answer
- `external_help_required` (on `topics` table) - boolean flag for topics needing external review after failed Socratic rescue

### What Queue Replaces

- Runtime-only queues
- Hidden orchestrators
- In-memory session engines
- Proactive scheduling systems
- Complex state machines

## 5. Chunking & Ingestion: Sliding Window & Multi-Modal (Deterministic)

### What

**Deterministic Chunking & Multi-Modal Ingestion Pipeline** — converts PDFs, structured Markdown, and YouTube video lectures into standard `ExtractedDocument` structures with deterministic session boundaries.

### Ingestion Engines

1. **Standard PDF Ingestion**: `pdfcpu` extracts text from standard PDFs with bookmark-aware or deterministic chapter boundaries.
2. **Deep Structured PDF Ingestion (`deep_pdf` / PyMuPDF4LLM)**: Pro-tiered extension parser converts complex PDFs into structured Markdown. Preserves tables (`|---|`) and code fences (` ``` `), running heading-aligned markdown chunking (`SplitMarkdownIntoChunks`).
3. **YouTube Video Lecture Ingestion (`youtube` / `yt-dlp`)**: Free-tiered extension extracts video metadata, timestamped chapters, and subtitles/transcripts, mapping chapters 1:1 into canonical `ExtractedDocument` sections with time markers `(MM:SS - MM:SS)`. Enables embedded playback with timestamp navigation and offline video playback.

### Why

Intentionally removed:
- Semantic topic chunking
- AI-generated chunk boundaries
- Advanced syllabus graphing
- Autonomous chunk orchestration

**Reason**: Deterministic chunking simpler, inspectable, sufficient for MVP.

### How

**Sliding Window Parameters:**
- **Embedding Chunk size**: 500 words (bounds: 350–650 words)
- **Reading Session Window**: 2,500–3,000 words
- **Overlap**: Sentence / paragraph boundary aware (no arbitrary mid-sentence cuts)
- **Code & Markdown**: Tables and code blocks kept intact via markdown chunking

Deterministic chunking pipeline:
1. Ingest PDF / Markdown / YouTube Transcripts
2. Split into ~500-word semantic chunks (preserving headings, tables, code, or chapter time bounds)
3. Sliding Window / Heading Chunking → Deterministic boundaries (no AI)
4. **Insert READING tasks** → Sized for study sessions into `study_queue`

**AI Cleanup Fallback (2026-07-11):**
When user clicks "AI Clean Up" on notebook chapters, three-tier fallback on LLM failure:
1. Try LLM — if it works, use LLM chapters
2. If LLM fails/unavailable, try bookmark-based chapters (call `DraftSyllabusChapters` with nil provider)
3. If no bookmarks either, create single "General" chapter covering all pages
Status always ends `"draft_ready"`. No error returned to frontend.

**CleanTopicTitle Utility (`internal/utils/hash.go`):**
Formats raw topic IDs like `nb-uuid-ch-01-chapter-1` into clean user-facing titles like "Chapter 1: Chapter 1". Used across repository layer, scheduler, and app_study.go for consistent display.

**Block Storage (chunks table):**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | Unique chunk identifier |
| `topic_id` | Topic reference |
| `chunk_text` | Text content |
| `page_num` | Page provenance |
| `token_count` | Word/token count |
| `embedding_ref` | Vector store reference |

### Retrieval

RAG pipeline remains topic-scoped:
1. Validate active topic context
2. Embed user query
3. Retrieve top-k chunks within `block_id` scope
4. Build prompt with retrieved context
5. Execute one LLM request

## 6. RAG Pipeline (Topic-Scoped)

### What

Deterministic single-turn pipeline for Ask AI + Explain use cases.

### Why

Maintains control, cost, + predictable behavior.

### How

1. Validate active topic context
2. Embed user query
3. Retrieve top-k chunks within topic scope
4. Build structured prompt with:
   - User question
   - Topic metadata
   - Retrieved context chunks
   - Output constraints
5. Execute one LLM request
6. Return response with citations

Constraints:
- No global retrieval by default
- Strict token budget at prompt assembly stage
- Stateless requests, no conversation memory

## 6.1 Local Embedding Runtime Dependencies

### What

Embedding pipeline depends on local model/runtime assets in `asset/` folder.

### Why

Embedding generation must be deterministic + available without external vector services.

### How

- Required assets (must exist in `asset/` folder):
  - `asset/tokenizer.json`
  - `asset/model_int8.onnx`
  - `asset/onnxruntime.dll` (Windows runtime)
  - `asset/vec0.dll` (sqlite-vec extension on Windows builds)
- Validate assets at startup before enabling ingestion/retrieval features.
- Missing dependency → explicit setup guidance + clear failure.

## 6.2 SQLite Connection Pool + vec0 Extension Management

### What

SQLite maintains single persistent connection with sqlite-vec (vec0) extension loaded.

### Why

SQLite extensions are connection-scoped. Multiple DB connections → only first has extension loaded. Subsequent connections fail with "no such module: vec0" errors.

### How

- **Single Connection Pool:** `SetMaxOpenConns(1)` + `SetMaxIdleConns(1)` enforce exactly one active DB connection.
- **Extension Loading:** At `db.Init()`, SQLite connection loads vec0 via driver-level `sqliteConn.LoadExtension()` (not SQL `LOAD_EXTENSION`).
- **Vector Table Storage:** All vectors stored in vec0 virtual table with integer rowids (not string IDs). Chunk IDs mapped to SQLite rowids before insert/query.
- **Vector Serialization:** Float32 embedding vectors serialized to JSON strings before binding to DB parameters, since `database/sql` doesn't support slice types directly.

**Architectural Constraints:**
- Never increase `MaxOpenConns` from 1; permanent requirement.
- All vector ops must resolve string chunk IDs → integer rowids first (via `lookupChunkRowID()`).
- All embeddings must be JSON-serialized before DB binding (via `vectorToJSON()`).

**Resource Cleanup:**
- Call `db.Close()` in test cleanup handlers to release connection before temp directory removal (prevents Windows file lock errors).
- On shutdown, connection automatically closed by DB driver.

## 7. Scheduling: Queue-Driven (Simplified)

### What

**FSRS = scheduling algorithm ONLY** — not orchestrator, session manager, or hidden engine.

### Multi-Notebook Priority System

Officially supports multiple notebooks with deterministic biasing:

- Notebooks have `priority INTEGER DEFAULT 5` (1-10 scale)
- Higher priority notebooks surface more frequently
- Lower priority notebooks still eventually appear
- Notebook priority = **bias**, NOT absolute control

### Queue Ordering Rules

**Ordering: deterministic → priority-biased → anti-starvation balanced**

**NOT:** adaptive scheduling, autonomous pacing, or AI-driven prioritization.

Explicit priority hierarchy with notebook biasing:

| Order | Task Type | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 7 | `FLASHCARD_GENERATE` (cloud sync) | Sync pending flashcard data |
| 6 | `SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL` (concept rescue) | Blocks queue after 2nd quiz failure; requires intervention |
| 5 | `FLASHCARD_REVIEW` (due reviews) | Spaced repetition is time-sensitive (Retention Layer) |
| 4 | `REREAD` (remediation) | Timely follow-up on failed material (Reading Layer) |
| 3 | `QUIZ` | Assessment after reading (Reading Layer) |
| 2 | `MILESTONE_EXAM` | Cumulative mastery exam every 10 quizzes (Reading Layer) |
| 1 | `READING` | New material after obligations (Reading Layer) |
| 0 | `EXAMINER` | Optional advanced assessment (Retention Layer) |

**Deterministic Query-Time Rules:**
- Same `study_queue` state → same task order always
- No runtime adaptation based on user behavior
- No AI-driven dynamic reprioritization
- Notebook priority = static bias coefficient, not adaptive weighting

**Ordering Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM study_queue sq
LEFT JOIN notebooks n ON sq.notebook_id = n.id
WHERE sq.status = 'PENDING'
ORDER BY
  CASE sq.task_type
    WHEN 'FLASHCARD_GENERATE' THEN 7
    WHEN 'SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL' THEN 6
    WHEN 'FLASHCARD_REVIEW' THEN 5
    WHEN 'REREAD' THEN 4
    WHEN 'QUIZ' THEN 3
    WHEN 'MILESTONE_EXAM' THEN 2
    WHEN 'READING' THEN 1
    WHEN 'EXAMINER' THEN 0
    ELSE 0
  END DESC,
  COALESCE(n.priority, 5) DESC,
  (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(sq2.completed_at), '') FROM study_queue sq2 WHERE sq2.notebook_id = sq.notebook_id AND sq2.status = 'COMPLETED') ASC,
  COALESCE(sq.created_at, '') ASC,
  sq.id ASC;
```

### How Retention Layer (FSRS) Integrates with Queue

**Important**: FSRS for long-term retention (Flashcards, Examiner). Quizzes = short-term comprehension, do NOT update FSRS state.

1. Cards become **due** (per FSRS calculation):
   - Insert `FLASHCARD_REVIEW` task into `study_queue` (one task per block)
   - Set `priority` based on overdue duration

2. Dashboard queries `study_queue` with ordering rules above

3. User completes flashcard session → FSRS calculates next interval

4. New `FLASHCARD_REVIEW` task scheduled for future due date

### FSRS Calibration (Simplified)

**New flashcards start in clean Review state** with day-based offsets based on quiz performance:

- **Ace (100% quiz score):** 3-day offset before first review
- **Pass (<100% quiz score):** 1-day offset before first review
- **Default (no quiz attempt):** Tomorrow offset (1 day)

**Implementation:**
- All new FSRS cards start with `StateCode: 2` (Review state) to bypass FSRS intraday learning phase
- Initial `due_at` calculated based on latest quiz attempt score for topic
- Clean state ensures predictable initial review intervals without simulation overhead

**Changes Made (2026-06-28):**
- Removed `scheduler.NextFSRSState` review simulation from `internal/study/flashcard.go`
- Initialized all flashcards with `StateCode: 2` (Review state) to bypass FSRS intraday learning phase
- Set initial `due_at` based on quiz score:
  - **Ace (100%):** 3 days offset
  - **Pass (<100%):** 1 day offset
- Updated `TestFSRSCalibrationEasyAndDoubleGood` in `quiz_flashcard_test.go` to assert clean Review state (Reps = 0, StateCode = 2) + day-based offsets

### Dashboard Streak Calendar (2026-06-28)

**Monthly Streak Calendar widget** in dashboard sidebar tracks study consistency:

**Implementation:**
- **Database Layer**: `GetCompletedTaskTimes()` in `internal/db/study_queue_repo.go` queries all completed task timestamps
- **Backend Logic**: `GetStreakState(timezoneOffsetMinutes int)` in `app_study.go` computes streaks with timezone alignment
- **Frontend**: Calendar widget in `Dashboard.vue` with dynamic month layout, active day highlighting, streak metrics

**Features:**
- Highlights days with completed study tasks (reading, quiz, socratic tutor, review sessions)
- Tracks `current_streak` + `longest_streak`
- Timezone-aware: converts UTC timestamps to local day boundaries
- Glowing fire icon pulses when user completes task today
- Custom tooltip overlays showing activity details on hover

**Dashboard Layout Optimizations:**
- Flashcard Reviews Hero Card: High-priority widget showing due count + overdue deck size
- Action Contexts: "Continue Reading" titles with "Resume" buttons for active readings
- Telemetry Widget Relocation: Profile Study Pacing moved to bottom of main column

### Cloud Sync with Stable Identifiers (2026-06-28)

**Cloud sync payload uses stable identifiers** instead of local database IDs for cross-student analytics:

**Changes:**
- **SyncPayload.Logs** now uses `[]SyncLogEntry` with `FileHash` (SHA-256 file hash) + `Filename` (plain filename from `filepath.Base()`) + `PageNumber` fields
- Replaces `[]FSRSReviewLog` with local IDs (`topic_id`, `reference_id`)
- Local `FSRSReviewLog` struct unchanged for internal use
- Server receives stable identifiers for dashboard analytics

**Data Chain for File Identification:**
`review_log.reference_id` → `flashcards.id` (get `source_chunk_id`) → `chunks.id` (get `page_num`) → `notebook_topics.topic_id` (get `notebook_id`) → `notebooks.file_path` (get `filepath.Base()`)

**Delta Sync:**
- `GetUnsentReviewLogs()` in `internal/db/fsrs_review_log_repo.go` fetches only unsent events
- Eliminates duplicates + provides file hash + page number for cloud sync
- `SetLastSyncedAt()` updates timestamp after successful sync

**Classroom Integration:**
- `classroom_code` field in sync payload for teacher-student association
- Clerk authentication support for cloud dashboard access

### Task Lifecycle Semantics

Explicit state transitions:

```
PENDING → ACTIVE (when user opens task)
ACTIVE → COMPLETED (on successful completion)
ACTIVE → SKIPPED (on user bypass)
ACTIVE → FAILED (on quiz generation error)
```

**Crash Recovery:**
- ACTIVE tasks older than 30-minute timeout revert to PENDING on startup
- Ensures restart-safe queue recovery
- `activated_at` timestamp tracks activation time

### Dashboard Starvation Protection

Prevents review monopolization (e.g., 500 flashcards blocking reading):

**Deterministic Balancing Rule (Query-Time Only):**
After 5 review tasks (`FLASHCARD_REVIEW` or `REREAD`), surface 1 `READING` task.

- Implemented as SQL query logic, not background process
- No autonomous queue rebalancing
- No hidden scheduling daemon
- Explicit, inspectable, reproducible behavior

**Anti-Drift Safeguard:** Balancing rules = static SQL ordering constraints, not adaptive runtime systems. No behavioral learning, no dynamic pacing, no runtime adaptation.

### Reread Loop Protection

Maximum reread attempts: **1** (default)

- `reread_attempt` counter tracked per topic (topic_id PK in `reread_attempts`)
- After max reached: SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL rescue task inserted (see Socratic Rescue Pipeline below)
- No infinite reread loops
- Continue queue progression via intervention flow

### Quiz Generation States

Explicit generation lifecycle for QUIZ tasks:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `GENERATING` | LLM call in progress |
| `READY` | Quiz ready for user |
| `FAILED` | Generation error |

**Flow:**
1. User signals reading complete (trust-based)
2. Reading completion closes reading task only; does not determine mastery or remediation quality
3. QUIZ task inserted with `GENERATING` state
4. LLM called synchronously
5. On success: `generation_status = READY`
6. On failure: `generation_status = FAILED` (dashboard surfaces explicitly)

**MVP Simplification Note:**
Generation status colocated on QUIZ task row. Intentionally mixes:
- Task lifecycle (`PENDING` → `ACTIVE` → `COMPLETED`)
- Generation lifecycle (`GENERATING` → `READY`/`FAILED`)

Acceptable for MVP. Future refactoring may separate generation state to `quiz_sets` table.

### Flashcard Review Granularity

**One `FLASHCARD_REVIEW` task = one review session for a block/chunk.**

- Do NOT create one queue task per flashcard
- Single task = "review all due cards in this block"
- Prevents queue explosion with many cards

### Task Priority Order (Legacy Reference)

**⚠️ OUTDATED.** Actual priority ordering defined by SQL query above (Section 7). Two priority conventions exist:
- **Task type tiers** (CASE statement): higher number = more important task type
- **`sq.priority`** (task field): lower number = higher priority (ASC)
- **`n.priority`** (notebook field): higher number = more frequent (DESC)

Canonical ORDER BY: `task_type_tier DESC, n.priority DESC, last_completed_at ASC, created_at ASC, id ASC`

| Legacy Priority | Task Type | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 7 | FLASHCARD_GENERATE | Cloud sync pending |
| 6 | SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL | 2nd quiz failure rescue |
| 5 | FLASHCARD_REVIEW | FSRS due date passed |
| 4 | REREAD (remediation) | Failed quiz |
| 3 | QUIZ | Reading completion |
| 2 | MILESTONE_EXAM | After 10th quiz per notebook |
| 1 | READING | New material ingestion |
| 0 | EXAMINER | Mastery threshold met |

### Adaptive Token-Budget Reading Windows

Problem:
Fixed page-count scheduling produced inconsistent workloads because page density varies across textbooks, slides, OCR PDFs, technical content.

Solution:
Scheduler uses token-budget-driven adaptive page windows.

Core flow:
reading minutes
    -> token budget
    -> adaptive page accumulation
    -> page window
    -> token-aware workload estimation

Key behaviors:
- Dense pages -> fewer pages
- Sparse slides -> more pages
- OCR/query failures -> page-based fallback

Constants:
- WordsPerMinute = 200
- TargetSessionWords = 2500
- MinMinutesPerPage = 1.0
- MinutesPerPage = 2.5 (legacy fallback only)

Adaptive Window Logic:
1. Convert reading budget into token budget
2. Incrementally accumulate pages using per-page token counts
3. Stop once accumulated tokens approach target workload
4. Preserve ClampWindowPages behavior near topic end
5. Fall back to page heuristics if token data unavailable

Estimation Logic:
- Actual task minutes estimated from extracted token counts
- Sparse content uses minimum page floors
- OCR/query failures use legacy page heuristics

Determinism:
- Same chunk data -> same adaptive windows
- No AI/runtime learning
- Pure query-driven scheduling

### Examiner Task Policy

EXAMINER tasks:
- Inserted after mastery thresholds met (e.g., quiz scores > 80%)
- Assigned elevated queue priority (appear naturally in flow)
- Remain optional (user can skip)
- Appear through deterministic queue ordering, NOT hidden orchestration

Prevents starvation: EXAMINER tasks tier 7 in priority hierarchy, ensuring reviews + reading not blocked.

### Socratic Rescue Pipeline (2-Strike)

Student fails quiz twice on same topic → guided rescue flow:

**Strike 1**: REREAD task inserted (standard remediation)
**Strike 2**: SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL task inserted, QUIZ marked COMPLETED, FSRS cards deleted

**Flow:**
```plaintext
[Quiz Fail #1] → REREAD task → Student re-reads → Quiz again
                                                    ↓
                                            [Quiz Fail #2]
                                                    ↓
                                    SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL task (blocks queue)
                                                    ↓
                                    Student completes external Socratic prompt
                                                    ↓
                                        Re-quiz (one shot)
                                       ↙                ↘
                              [Pass]                    [Fail]
                               ↓                          ↓
                        Flashcards generated        EXTERNAL_HELP_REQUIRED
                        Topic mastered              Queue unblocks
                                                   Notice shown
```

**Key behaviors:**
- SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL sits at priority tier 6 (between FLASHCARD_REVIEW at tier 5 + FLASHCARD_GENERATE at tier 7)
- Student cannot skip — must complete rescue session
- Re-quiz pass → flashcards generated, topic mastered
- Re-quiz fail → `external_help_required` flag set on topic, queue unblocks, notice shown
- No flashcards generated for failed concepts at any point
- Single rescue cycle only — no infinite loops

**External prompt mode:** Rescue UI provides pre-engineered Socratic prompt template with source text that student copies to external LLM. No local LLM integration required.

**Database changes:**
- `topics.external_help_required` boolean column tracks topics needing external review
- `study_queue.task_type` accepts `SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL`
- Re-quiz tasks include `"source": "socratic_rescue_requiz"` in payload for identification

### Unified Queue Transition Router
All study queue task transitions and completions are strictly routed through `StudyService.TransitionTask` in `internal/study/queue_transition.go` as the single switchboard:

| Event | Source Task | Target / Result | Pipeline Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `COMPLETE_READING` | `READING` / `REREAD` | `QUIZ` (Pending) | Generates quiz questions and transitions task |
| `SUBMIT_QUIZ` | `QUIZ` | `QuizResult` | Evaluates attempt, schedules reread/rescue/re-quiz/cards |
| `COMPLETE_FLASHCARDS`| `FLASHCARD_GENERATE` | Terminal | Clears pending flashcard sync generation tasks |
| `COMPLETE_FLASHCARD_REVIEW` | `FLASHCARD_REVIEW` | `COMPLETED` | Verifies zero remaining due cards and completes review session |
| `COMPLETE_SOCRATIC_RESCUE` | `SOCRATIC_REMEDIAL` | `QUIZ` (Re-quiz) | Completes rescue session & inserts follow-up re-quiz |
| `COMPLETE_MILESTONE_EXAM` | `MILESTONE_EXAM` | `COMPLETED` | Finalizes active milestone exam |
| `FAIL_TASK` | Any | `FAILED` | Transactionally marks task status as failed |

### FLASHCARD_GENERATE Task

Cloud sync operations use dedicated `FLASHCARD_GENERATE` task type:

- Inserted when cloud sync fails (after retry exhaustion)
- Resolved (COMPLETED) when sync succeeds on next attempt
- Priority tier 7 (highest, above all other task types)
- Prevents data loss by ensuring pending sync data not forgotten

### MILESTONE_EXAM Task

Cumulative mastery exam aggregated from recent quiz history:

- Auto-inserted every 10 completed quizzes per notebook (`count % 10 == 0 && count > 0`)
- Priority tier 2 (between QUIZ at tier 3 and READING at tier 1)
- Payload format: `{"quizzes": {"<attempt_id>": [1,0,1,0]}, "passing_score": 70, "quiz_count": 10}`
- Correctness arrays computed at insert time (not query time) for self-contained research queries
- Deduplicates against existing MILESTONE_EXAM tasks for same notebook
- Gracefully skips corrupt quiz attempts (nil correctness flags)
- Reuses questions from past quiz attempts — no LLM generation needed
- EXAMINER remains separate for written short-answer assessments

### Reading Completion (Trust-Based)

Reading tasks use trust-based completion:

- User decides when reading complete
- Complete Session button stays enabled during active reading task
- StartPage authoritative for opening context
- EndPage informational only
- No enforced page-completion validation
- No surveillance logic, reading timers, or engagement tracking
- Lightweight MVP approach

Reading completion does not measure quality or mastery. Only closes reading task + allows backend to generate follow-up quiz checkpoint.

### Skip Semantics

Explicit terminal states preserve audit trail:

| Status | Meaning | Resurfacing |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `COMPLETED` | Successfully finished | No |
| `SKIPPED` | User bypassed | Possible (manual retry) |
| `FAILED` | Error/generation failure | Can retry |

Skipped tasks auditable, can resurface if needed. Do NOT silently mark skipped tasks as completed.

### No Proactive Scheduling

- No background workers scanning for "what's next"
- No autonomous flow engines
- Queue = **only** source of next actions
- Deterministic MVP > premature optimization

## 8. LLM Layer: Synchronous Only

### What

Minimal provider interface for OpenAI-compatible APIs. **All generation synchronous.** Dual-tier LLM system with Fast + Heavy models.

### Why

- No background workers
- No async orchestration
- No hidden goroutines
- Deterministic MVP > premature optimization
- Cost optimization via model tiering

### How

**Provider presets:**
- Groq (fast, free tier)
- OpenAI (balanced)
- OpenRouter (flexible)
- Custom (user-configured)

**Dual-tier LLM:**
- **Fast**: Quick responses for RAG, explanations, simple tasks
- **Heavy**: Complex reasoning, quiz generation, detailed analysis

**Provider config fields:**
- base_url
- api_key (stored in OS keyring)
- model
- timeout_ms

**Synchronous Flow:**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | User clicks Complete |
| 2 | Frontend shows loading spinner |
| 3 | Backend calls LLM synchronously |
| 4 | Content returned in response |
| 5 | Task inserted into `study_queue` |

**Interface operations:**
- `generate_answer(prompt)` - RAG responses
- `generate_quiz(topic_context)` - Quiz creation

**Debug Logging (2026-06-26):**
- All LLM calls flow through `Provider.GenerateAnswer()`
- Single debug write at `provider.go:277-279` covers all call sites
- Writes to `dev_data/logs/llm_prompt.log` with timestamp + model name
- Format: `[TIMESTAMP] MODEL_NAME\nPROMPT\n---\n`
- Enables prompt inspection for debugging + optimization

**Non-goals:**
- No LangChain
- No autonomous agents
- No multi-step orchestration framework
- No async job queues

## 9. Offline Strategy

### What

Offline-first core with explicit online-only AI operations.

### Why

Users must keep studying even without network access.

### How

**Offline enabled:**
- Reading from `chunks` table
- FSRS review cycles (queue-driven)
- Queue progress tracking

**Online required:**
- Ask AI (RAG + LLM)
- Quiz generation (synchronous LLM call)

**Failure mode:**
- Immediate, explicit UI error
- No hidden fallback models
- No synthetic placeholder answers

**Queue Persistence Enables Offline:**
- `study_queue` local SQLite
- Task state survives app restarts
- No runtime-only queues that vanish

## 10. Retention Policy

### What

Keep durable learning state, prune transient operational artifacts.

### Why

Preserves learning continuity while controlling local growth.

### How

Retain:
- FSRS card state
- Topic progress
- User-facing summaries

Prune:
- Debug logs
- Intermediate AI outputs
- Temporary retrieval traces

## 10. Queue Router (Thin Task Router)

### What

Queue router = **query-and-route layer**, not flow engine or orchestration system.

### Responsibilities

Router ONLY:
1. **Fetch next pending task** from `study_queue` (deterministic ordering rules)
2. **Mount correct module** based on `task_type`
3. **Pass context** (`block_id`, `related_id`) to module
4. **Mark tasks complete** when module signals completion
5. **Insert follow-up tasks** based on explicit completion rules

Generated follow-up quiz tasks may mount immediately after Reader completion if next pending queue item. Router still owns transition; Reader does not.

### What It Does NOT Do

- Manage hidden state machines
- Proactively schedule flows
- Own remediation logic
- Run autonomous pipelines
- Control dual timer engines
- Manage event buses

### Hard Invariant: No Background Queue Mutation

**"No background queue mutation without explicit trigger."**

All queue mutations MUST originate from:
- Explicit user actions (clicking complete, skip)
- Deterministic startup recovery (timeout stale ACTIVE tasks)
- Synchronous completion flows (task A completes → task B inserted)

**Prohibited:**
- Daemon loops scanning + modifying queue
- Auto-balancers running on timers
- Hidden startup repair jobs
- Autonomous queue injectors
- Event-driven queue mutation

### Example: Quiz Completion Flow

```
Quiz Module reports score: 60% (below threshold)
→ Queue router marks QUIZ task COMPLETED
→ Queue router inserts REREAD task + other follow-up tasks as needed
→ Dashboard regains ownership + shows next pending task
```

User can complete or skip REREAD task. Queue router does NOT force loops.

## 11. Technical Debt Strategy

### Context

Previous architecture review identified `app.go` + `notebook_endpoints.go` as potentially oversized coordination files.

### Current State

After cleanup + modularization:
- `app.go`: ~600-700 lines (acceptable MVP scale)
- `notebook_endpoints.go`: ~600-700 lines (acceptable MVP scale)

### Decision

**Do NOT aggressively split further during Sprint 1.**

Extract further only if:
- Duplication increases
- Navigation degrades
- Responsibilities become unclear

**Avoid premature fragmentation.**

### Acceptance Criteria

- Files remain under ~800 lines
- Clear separation of concerns maintained
- No action required unless complexity metrics degrade

---

## 12. Task-to-Page Execution Contract

### What

Dashboard tasks open target pages with context preloaded.

### Why

Guided tutor must convert queue tasks into immediate action.

### How

1. Dashboard queries `study_queue` for next `PENDING` task
2. Task card displays `task_type` + context
3. User clicks task → Router navigates to module
4. Module receives `block_id` + `related_id` from task
5. Module loads content + renders

Reader completion may immediately surface generated Quiz task as next queue item. Dashboard/queue-router handoff, not direct Reader-to-Quiz module route.

**Example:**
- Task: `QUIZ` with `block_id: "quiz-set-123"`
- Click → Quiz module mounts
- Quiz module loads quiz_set by `block_id`
- User completes → Queue router marks complete → Next task appears

## 13. Extension System Runtime (uv-powered)

### What
Optional capabilities (e.g. YouTube audio extraction, advanced scraping) can be added dynamically using Python extensions without modifying core backend code.

### Why
- **Python Ecosystem**: The AI/ML ecosystem moves fast in Python; trying to rewrite all tools in Go is inefficient.
- **Isolating Fragile Dependencies**: Heavy Python dependencies (`yt-dlp`, `edge-tts`) shouldn't pollute the core Go backend.
- **Zero Global Pollution**: By using `uv`, we avoid modifying system-level Python environments and keep all dependencies sandboxed per-extension.

### How
- **Engine**: We use Astral's `uv` executable, bundled alongside our binary or downloaded on demand. `uv` resolves packages incredibly fast (10-100x faster than `pip`).
- **Isolation**: Each Python extension receives its own dedicated virtual environment, stored typically in `%APPDATA%/Studyloop/extensions/<ext_id>/.venv` (Windows) or equivalent.
- **PyArmor Protection**: To protect intellectual property (such as proprietary parsing algorithms), extension Python scripts can be distributed via PyArmor obfuscation, while remaining executable via the standard Python interpreter created by `uv`.
- **Pre-Toggle Verification**: Before enabling an extension in the UI, the Go backend runs a readiness check (smoke test). If `uv` fails to build the virtual environment or dependencies are missing, the UI gracefully blocks the toggle, preventing runtime crashes.
- **Interface**: Wails Go API handles downloading the ZIP manifest, setting up `uv venv`, and delegating input/output to the python entry point. The extension merely prints structured data (or status) to STDOUT.
